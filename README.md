# Card-Game
I approached this problem by simulating thousands of repeated games using a Monte Carlo method to evaluate different decision strategies. By modeling the game logic probabilistically, I determined the optimal timing for “PLAY”, “CHECK”, and “REVEAL” actions to minimize risk and maximize long-term win probability.
