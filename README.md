# Card-Game
Consider the following game. You and your opponent each have a deck of six cards numbered 1 to 6. In front of each of you, there is a one card face-up labeled 0 representing your stack. Players alternate between potentially playing their cards face-down on their own stack; a player wins if at the beginning of their turn, they can reveal a 6 atop their own stack.

On your turn, you will shuffle your remaining deck and then randomly pick 2 cards. You may then do one of several actions.
- “PLAY” a card face-down on your stack that is either 1 greater or 2 greater than the card beneath it
- “PASS” your turn
- “CHECK” your opponent’s top two cards on their stack. If these two cards differ by 2, then they must return all their played cards to their deck, leaving just the face-up 0
- “REVEAL” by flipping over your top card. If this is a 6, you win the game.
Regardless of your action, return your unplayed cards back to your deck, ending your turn.

You are going first. Answer the following in 300 words:


a) After two turns, your stack is 0, 2, 4. Your opponent also has two face-down cards atop their 0. What should you do?


b) Suppose you play this game repeatedly with the same opponent. Propose a general strategy to maximize your win probability.
